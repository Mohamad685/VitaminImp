    Vitamin D is both a nutrient we eat and a hormone our bodies make.
    It is a fat-soluble vitamin that has long been known to help the body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorus; both are critical for building bone.<br><br>
    Also, laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections and reduce inflammation.<br><br>
    Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones and teeth. It also plays many other important roles in the body, including regulating inflammation and immune function.<br><br>
    Despite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin but a hormone or prohormone.<br><br>
    In this article, we look at the body-style of vitamin D, what happens to the body when people do not get enough, and how to boost vitamin D intake.<br><br>

        <h2> Healthy bones</h2>
        <p>Vitamin D promotesTrusted Source intestinal calcium absorption and helps maintain adequate blood levels of calcium and phosphorus, 
            which is necessary for healthy bone mineralization.
        </p>
        <h2>Immune function</h2>
        <p>Studies have shown vitamin D to have a positive effect on the immune response of human cells, 
            researchers are yet to replicate these findings in controlled human trials.<br><br>
            An adequate intake of vitamin D may support good immune function and reduce the risk of autoimmune diseases.
